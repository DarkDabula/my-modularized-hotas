# Thoughts and concepts

# HOTAS devices
## Throttle lever
The throttle lever should contain following controls
- 4 buttons and one HAT control for the thumb
- 2 buttons for the forefinger
- a rocker switch for the longfinger and fourth finger

## Joystick
- 2 buttons, one HAT control and one analogue stick
- a rocker switch for the forefinger and longfinger, the rocker switch should be able to press both buttons at the same time
- maybe more

# Modularization
To make the whole design process easier, each control(-group) will be in a separate module. The separate modules will be attached wihin the throttle lever and joystick.

## Control modules
The possible control could be put into following categories
- 2 button control
- rocker switch (two variants: one or two buttons at the same time pushable)
- HAT control
- analogue stick

## Sizes and forms
Maybe its possible to standardize the size and form of the modules so they can be exchanged. It's thinkable that the control types could be grouped in the following manner
- 2 button module, rocker switch module
- HAT module, analogue stick module
