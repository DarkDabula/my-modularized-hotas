# My Modularized HOTAS
A modularized, mostly 3D printed HOTAS with HID emulation via Arduino

## Motivation
On Christmas 2020 I stumbled over [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) and got hooked. After a while I began to play it in VR.
At this point I realized I would need a HOTAS system. The problem was that through the pademic all systems were mostly sold out. 
I had already a joystick so I built a throttle lever made of metal parts, wood and some electronics. And it served me pretty well.

But after hundreds of hours I recognized that the simple push buttons got weak and that I would need more buttons for effective playing in VR.
In 2021 I bought a 3D printer and the idea was born to contruct a new and better throttle lever and maybe after this a new joystick.

## Goals
- As much 3D printed parts as possible and reasonable
- Modularized design for easy printing, assembly, customization and repair

## Current state
See [here](./status.md)

## Concepts
See [here](./concepts.md)

## External parts
For this project additional parts/components are needed besides the 3D printed ones.
