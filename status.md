This file will be a kind of diary for the projects, to document the progress

I redesigned the base plate to reduce need of filament. Additionally I replaced the original lock-in position by a kind of gear to allow finer angles of adjustment around the vertical axe.
I also do a test print ob the counterpart for it.

## 07. Feb 2022
Printed the first version of the base plate with joint. We will see if the joint is strong and stiff enough.

Replaced the original metal base plate by a thin printed prototype to check if the holes where at the right position. On the base plate there will a joint to connect it with the leverl.

I created the first test pieces for the adjustable joint. With that it should possible to adjust the angle of the lever in relation to the horizontal line. This was my third try after evaluating other designs.

I did a small revision of the rocker switch module. Its slightly smaller and have holes to reduce material. The rocker itself is black because I was too lazy to change the filament for the test print. ^^

Today I printed the early version of parts for the rocker switch and assembled them with the switches and springs.
